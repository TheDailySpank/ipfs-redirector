# ipfs-redirector
Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey script to intercept and re-write IPFS links.

No more having to edit the link in the address bar manually.

Add this script to Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey to automatically re-format IPFS links to a server of your choice. By default, it's http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Edit the 'ipfsHost' var to your liking or simply comment the default out and uncomment another one of the listed gateways.
